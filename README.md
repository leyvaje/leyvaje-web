## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Local Development
No build step needed — `index.html` works in the browser immediately.

```bash
# Validate and build the static site
npm run lint
npm run build

# Preview the production output
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory dist
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

### ChillBill

The German ChillBill pages are available at:

- `/chillbill` — product page
- `/chillbill/support` — support and bug-reporting guidance
- `/chillbill/privacy` — privacy policy

German is the canonical language for the App Store URLs. English and Spanish
can be added later under `/chillbill/en` and `/chillbill/es` without changing
the German URLs.
